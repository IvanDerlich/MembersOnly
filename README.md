# Members Only project
This project consists of using the bcrypt gem to have a first approach at authentication in rails. We will build an application that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if as a User you are logged in.
Also it was built using [Oding project guide](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication) that is about authentication as part of forms and authentication section in ruby on rails technical curriculum of [Microverse](microverse.org)
